/**
 * QHTI (qhti.bg) — a Bulgarian marine marketplace. The first listing-feed provider.
 *
 * ── Why an API adapter and not the product-page scraper ──────────────────────
 * qhti.bg is a Create React App single-page application. Every URL — the
 * catalogue and each individual listing alike — returns the same ~4.8KB shell with
 * an empty `<div id="root">` and only site-wide meta tags. There is no per-listing
 * og:title or og:image to read, so the HTML scraper would store one identical
 * generic description for every listing. The JSON the page's own client fetches is
 * the only real source of facts.
 *
 * ── The endpoint is PROVISIONAL ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `HOMEPAGE_ENDPOINT` below is the only place it appears. It is the endpoint that
 * works unauthenticated today, and it is NOT the catalogue: it is the selection
 * the site puts on its homepage, grouped into display buckets. The client is
 * expected to supply a supported active-listings endpoint (`ads/getAdsByActiveStatus`
 * returns 400 without parameters we do not yet know, and `ads/getAdBySlug` returns
 * 401), at which point this file is the only one that changes.
 *
 * That provisional status is reported honestly rather than hidden: the fetch
 * returns `complete: false`, which is what stops ingestion from ever concluding
 * that a listing absent from this response has been withdrawn. See the
 * disappearance note in ingest-content-source.service.ts.
 *
 * ── Category scope ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The client's request for this integration is boats and yachts specifically —
 * not engines, marine electronics, or parts, which QHTI's homepage payload mixes
 * into the same response. That restriction is enforced here, on the RAW ad's
 * `category` field, before a non-BOATS_AND_YACHTS entry is even normalized. See
 * `isEligibleQhtiCategory`.
